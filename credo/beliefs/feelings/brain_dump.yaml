  title: Immigration is a net positive force for America
  belief: feeling
  summary: Immigrants overall bring new energy to the workforce and provide work jobs that American workers overall do not want.
  caveats:
      - I don't know that this is actually true
      - Will need some actual data to support this
      - Need to find some counter arguments to this, Center for Immigration Studies

- topic: Trade
  title: Manufacturing jobs will not be coming back to America regardless of trade policy.
  belief: feeling
  summary: Because of global market forces there is no real incentive for major manufacturers to bring companies back to the US.  Even in the instances where manufacturing is prevelant, the increasing trends towards automation will reduce the employment impact of manufacturing jobs.  The United States, and indeed the western world is hurtling towards an increasingly automated service based economy.  We will need to think more broadly about the future of the economy as automation becomes increasingly prevalent
  caveats:
      - Automation has been a fundamental part of the economy for many years.
      - What are the major trade policies that have increased global trade?
      - What does history tell us about isolationist policies?

- topic: Healthcare
  title: A public option is strong middle ground policy for US Healthcare 
  belief: feeling
  summary: Single Payer systems ration healthcare by design.  Private payer systems lack standards, interoperability, technological sophistication, and negotiating power.  Single Payer Systems almost always see private insurance options arise due to low quality care scenarios that arise from healthcare rationing. The Private Payer system in the US is inefficient, lacks leverage, and is stifled due to the high barrier to entry for technological innovation.  In the US, employment seems to be a core requirement for having health insurance.
  caveats:
      - Why is healthcare so expensive in the US?
      - What are the healthcare systems of the top economic powers in the world?
      - Would a public option necessarily reduce competition in the US insurance market?

  title: Donald Trump's basic policies on immigration are infeasible
  belief: feeling
  summary:  John Oliver made a pretty convincing case that the concept of the 'wall' is totally unaffordable. It seems likely that the cost of enforcing these immigration policies are probably infeasible as well.  The solution to the 'problem' as it is described is probably much more expensive than the overall cost of illegal immigration to the us.
  caveats:
      - I need to get actual numbers on this.
      - Not sure what sources are credible for info on this.  Homeland security?
      - Need to look back at John Oliver's episode.
